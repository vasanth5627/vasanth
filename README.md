I have done the following things as part of GIT-002-01

Initialize an empty git repository.
Create a file named first.txt.
Add first.txt to the staging area.
Commit with the message “adding first.txt”.
Check out your commit with git log.
Create another file called second.txt.
Add second.txt to the staging area.
Commit with the message “adding second.txt”
Remove the first.txt file
Add this change to the staging area
Commit with the message “removing first.txt”
Check out your commits using git log
Create a github repository with your own name
Push your code to same repository
Host the repository on github pages and attach the link here
